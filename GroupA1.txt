GROUP A: Exercise 7-2: Accumulating totals in a single-level control.

        if(sectionNum != oldSectionNum)
        {
            System.out.println("Section Number " + oldSectionNum);
            totalSections = sectionNum;
            oldSectionNum = sectionNum;

        }
        
    1. What is the control break variable?
     sectionNum
    
    2. T/F The value of the control break variable should never be changed.
    False, the variable is updated ever time the section number changes.
    This is false because control breaks detect when variables change so that a 
    particular logic process can be initiated. If the control break variable did not change,
    the system would not know when a different section is being processed.
    
    3. Is totalSelections being calculated correctly?
    No. Based on the program, totalSections is being reset to 1 when sectionNum is updated
    which is an indication that totalSections will continuously loop and not accumulate the total.
    All sections are not being processed.

    No, This only assignes it the value of the sectionNum. 
    You need to increment totalSections variable each time.
     
    4. T/F In a control break program, it does not matter if the records in the input file are in a specific order.
    False, the order of the records matter because the program relies on detecting changes. The control break
    process can be incorrectly implemented which could make the totals wrong and could yield incorrect outputs.
