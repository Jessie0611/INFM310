GROUP A: Exercise 7-2: Accumulating totals in a single-level control.

        if(sectionNum != oldSectionNum)
        {
            System.out.println("Section Number " + oldSectionNum);
            totalSections = sectionNum;
            oldSectionNum = sectionNum;

        }
        
    1. What is the control break variable?
    oldSectionNum
    
    2. T/F The value of the control break variable should never be changed.
    False, the variable is updated ever time the section number changes.
    
    3. Is totalSelections being calculated correctly?
    No, This only assignes it the value of the sectionNum. You need to increment totalSections variable each time.
     
    4. T/F In a control break program, it does not matter if the records in the input file are in a specific order.
    False, the order of the records matter because the program relies on detecting changes.
